RadioPi design
==============

Hardware:
=========

  Raspberry Pi model B (might work with other models too)
  Rotary encoder with press button

  3-position switch (use not decided)
  Single pushbutton (use not decided)

  LCD display 4 lines x 20 characters, connected via USB (see lcdTerminal sub-project)

  amplifier & speaker
  mono volume control + mixing resistors
  headphone jack with disconnect
  micro USB socket for power --> 5v supplies Pi and amplifier


Wiring:
=======

  Audio jack (pi)  -->  headphone jack. If headphones not present, audio --> mixer board
  Mixer board  2x4k7 resistors to mix L&R audio to mono  --> volume control (Cable screen not connected here!)
  Volume control --> amplifier
  Amplifier --> speaker

  power in (microUSB) +   --> pi
                      +   --> volume control power switch --> amplifier
                      gnd --> pi
                      gnd --> amplifier





lcdTerminal design
==================

Hardware:
=========

  LCD module
  Arduino nano
  Contrast potentiometer
  Backlight resistor(s)

  Connections:
    LCD                     Arduino
    1  VSS                  GND
    2  VDD                  5v
    3  VO                   wiper of potentiometer 47k between 5v and gnd
    4  RS                   D2
    5  R/W                  D3
    6  E                    D4
    7  DB0                  D5
    8  DB1                  D6
    9  DB2                  D7
    10 DB3                  D8
    11 DB4                  D9
    12 DB5                  D10
    13 DB6                  D11
    14 DB7                  D12
    15 + backlight          5V via 47R (possibly switched for variable brightnes
    16 - backlight          GND
  These connections allow the arduino to be connected directly to pins 4..14 of the LCD module.
  The other pins are brought out by flying leads to veroboard.

Software:
=========

  Use "LiquidCrystal" library for display
  Store 4 lines of 20 characters to allow scrolling

  Input from uart --> display at current postion, except:
   CR  -- move to col 0
   LF  -- move down (scroll if at bottom)
   tbd -- clear screen
   tbd -- move up (scroll if at top)
   tbd -- set cursor to pos
  Characters past col 20 ignored
