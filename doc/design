RadioPi design
==============

Hardware:
=========

  Raspberry Pi model B (might work with other models too)
  Rotary encoder with press button

  3-position switch (use not decided)
  Single pushbutton (use not decided)

  lcdTerminal (see separate project)

  amplifier & speaker
  mono volume control + mixing resistors
  headphone jack with disconnect
  micro USB socket for power --> 5v supplies Pi and amplifier


Wiring:
=======

  Audio jack (pi)  -->  headphone jack. If headphones not present, audio --> mixer board
  Mixer board  2x4k7 resistors to mix L&R audio to mono  --> volume control (Cable screen not connected here!)
  Volume control --> amplifier
  Amplifier --> speaker

  power in (microUSB) +   --> pi
                      +   --> volume control power switch --> amplifier
                      gnd --> pi
                      gnd --> amplifier
