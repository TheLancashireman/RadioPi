RadioPi design
==============

Hardware:
=========

  Raspberry Pi model B (might work with other models too)
  Rotary encoder with press button, along with debounce and logic to decode to
    up/down pulses. Ask me for a circuit diagram if you want one.
  38kHz IR receiver
  lcdTerminal (see separate project)

Additionally, I used this extra hardware to build the player into an old transistor radio.

  amplifier & speaker
  mono volume control + mixing resistors
  headphone jack with disconnect
  micro USB socket for power --> 5v supplies Pi and amplifier
  small PSU smoothing PCB (on stripboard) to try to filter the Pi's noise.


Wiring:
=======

  Audio jack (pi)  -->  headphone jack. If headphones not present, audio --> mixer board
  Mixer board  2x4k7 resistors to mix L&R audio to mono  --> volume control (Cable screen not connected here!)
  Volume control --> amplifier
  Amplifier --> speaker

  power in (microUSB) +   --> pi
                      +   --> volume control power switch --> amplifier
                      gnd --> pi
                      gnd --> amplifier
